## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.6.3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I'm into python programming for a few weeks and in fact of that I'm not really familiar with the codes yet. Therefore I wanted to have my own collection of basic codes I can use when working with python.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repo contains two files:
- basic_codes.ipynb
- README.md
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Feel free to use my collection for your own work!
